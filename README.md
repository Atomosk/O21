Game History
------------

U95 (also called as _U-95_ on the title screen) is a game well known in 1990's Russian-speaking gaming community, since it was one of the first games published there.

It was created in 1995 by one of the first Russian game development companies, NIKITA (currently renamed to Nikita Online), for Windows 3.x.

### O21

Since the original game is probably named after a [German submarine U-95][u95.sub], that was sunk by Dutch [O 21][o21.sub], the authors decided to name the remake project O21, as a (wishfully) superior project (at least in some aspects).
