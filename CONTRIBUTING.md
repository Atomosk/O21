O21 Contributor Guide
=====================

Development Prerequisites
-------------------------

To develop O21, you'll need [.NET 7 SDK][dotnet] (or a later version).

Build the Project
-----------------

Execute the following shell command:

```console
$ dotnet build
```

Play the Original
-----------------

So far, the simplest way to play the original game is from [PlayMiniGames][playminigames.u95].

If the game sound is too loud and annoys you, you can disable it via the main menu. Unfortunately, PlayMiniGames' version of Windows 3.x doesn't seem to support Cyrillic, so you won't be able to read the actual names of the menu items. So, just open the first item of the main menu, and disable all the checkboxes there if you want to completely disable the in-game sound. 

Download the Original
---------------------

[Download it from the Old-Games.RU][old-games.u95].

SHA256 hash of the `U95.rar` file is `2F85B004B8C9BE21BE7327BD677370433DBD04B65F3B909561FE17EA6B43534A`.
